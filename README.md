# How to Submit Your npm-debug.log as a Gist

So you're using npm, and then suddenly, this totally uncool text appears on your terminal.

1. The first step here is to try to fix the error yourself! Check out the [troubleshooting](https://github.com/npm/npm/wiki/Troubleshooting) guide for help. As always, [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/npm) is a great place to check if other people have had the same problem.

2. If that fails or hasn't helped, open the folder of your project. You should see an npm-debug.log file there. Open it, and copy it.

3. Then go to the [gist website](https://gist.github.com/) and paste it in! Simple as that. Now you can link it to the npm issues and hopefully we'll fix whatever bug you're facing!
